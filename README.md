# Supplier-invoice-
In this project, I worked with a raw supplier invoice dataset that required significant cleaning before analysis. 
The data contained inconsistencies such as missing values, duplicate records, inconsistent date formats and unstructured fields.
I performed data cleaning and transformation using Excel, ensuring standardized formats, accurate totals and structured columns ready for reporting. 
This project highlights my ability to handle messy real-world data and prepare it for analysis. 
It reflects my understanding that strong insights start with clean, reliable data and attention to detail during the preprocessing stage.
